node index.ts
```

### Test the Endpoints
Use tools like **Postman** or **curl** to test the API. For example:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/create-campaign -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"campaignname":"Save the Forests", "description":"Protect trees", "targetamount":10000, "days":30}'
```
